#summary Detailed description of DACP requests

All the requests take the form of http://server:3689/ctrl-int/1/<command>

= playstatusupdate =

* *Request* /playstatusUpdate
 * *Params*
  * *revision-number* revision number 
  * *session-id* session id 
 * *Response* avdb
 * *Description* Jeff Sharkey says 

 "Something important to note is the revision-number field. By starting with revision-number=1, we know that we'll always get a response. However, a new revision-number is returned in the cmsr field. If we request that new revision-number, our HTTP request hangs until the next server event happens, providing push event notification. For example, our request might hang until the user manually changes tracks on the computer, or pauses the track, or maybe a TCP timeout happens."

This is true but from what I've seen the request tends to return and completely reset the state of your session, forcing you to login again.
